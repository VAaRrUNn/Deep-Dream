# Deep-Dream
This repo contains an implementation of Deep-Dream with GoogleNet in Pytorch. <br>
This repo work is highly inspired by [this medium post](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/deep-dream-visualizing-the-features-learnt-by-convolutional-networks-in-pytorch-b7296ae3b7f) by `Prarit Agarwal`. <br>
The objective of this repo is to make visualization easy by providing easy-to-use CLI, for working with different models and their layers. 
This repo is WIP.
Here's a video of generated images.
