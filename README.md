# Deep-Dream
This repo contains an implementation of Deep-Dream with GoogleNet in Pytorch.
This post is highly inspired by [this post](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/deep-dream-visualizing-the-features-learnt-by-convolutional-networks-in-pytorch-b7296ae3b7f) by `Prarit Agarwal`.
The goal of this repo is to make visualizaion easy by providing easy to use CLI, for working with different models and their layers. 
This repo is WIP.
